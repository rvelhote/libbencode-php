**PHP Bencode Library**

This library is just an experiment.

The BencodedDataTypes are little frankensteins the complicate what could be solved with the PHP basic types but that's 
entirely on purpose I assure you.

- Dictionary » BencodedDictionary => PHP Associative Array
- List » BencodedList » PHP Array
- String » BencodedString » Well... you know
- Integer » BencodedInteger » Hmm...

[This](https://medium.com/@webseanhickey/the-evolution-of-a-software-engineer-db854689243) might explain what I'm doing ;) ;)

More documentation to come.
